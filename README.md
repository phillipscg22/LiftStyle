# LiftStyle: Create Share Grow
Liftsyle is an application for smart phones (Android operating system compatible) that is designed to help 
those who wish to lead a healthy lifestyle and get in the gym. The app les users build and 
save workouts that they can view later to keep them motivated in the gym. 

To install the application follow the steps below:

1. First start by downloading the Rider IDE and installing the .NET and Xamarin libraries.
        While installing, ensure you download the Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android API version 29 or 30
2. Once your IDE is up and running, you will want to get the LiftStyle code into your projects. You can do this by using VCS and downloading from the GitHub, or using the attached code in the zip file and putting it directly in the src folder of the RiderProjects folder in your computer. 
3. After getting the project loaded into your Rider IDE, you need to set your phone up correctly. In order to install the application on your phone through Rider, you will need to put your phone into developer mode. To do this, go into your phone's settings. Click the "About phone" selection, and scroll down until you see the "Build Number" selection. Tap this 5-7 times and then you should get notification that your phone is in developer mode. 
4. Once your phone is in developer mode, ensure you have a cable to connect your phone to the pc running Rider. The cable must be a charging and transfer data cable to work, not just a charging cable. If you have the correct cable, you should get an alert on your phone once it is plugged in to enable usb debugging. Ensure you enable this feature. 
5. After usb debugging is enabled, you can look at your Rider IDE and your phone name should be in the selection box on the top right of the Rider IDE next to the run project button. 
6. If your phone is successfully viewed by the Rider IDE and the code is in your current project, all you have to do is build and run the project and the app will begin downloading on your phone. Once it is successfully built, it will automatically open and also create an icon in your application library.
